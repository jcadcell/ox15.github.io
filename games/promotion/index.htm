        <h1>Promotion</h1>
        <p>2+ players, play until the piece is in somebody's goal.</p>
        <h1>Materials</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A deck of playing cards or dice</li>
            <li>A small item (like a Lego piece, coin, etc) to use as a game piece</li>
            <li><a href="board.png">The Promotion game board</a> (if you don't want to print it, make one like the board shown below)</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="board.png" alt="There are 3 lanes on a sheet of graph paper. The spaces are numbered, and their sizes are 4x4 cells, 3x3, and 2x2. Player 1's goal is on top. The numbers decrease until the start space. The space above the start space is #1. The spaces below the start space have negative numbers.">
        <h1>Play</h1>
        <p>If you draw a joker, place the piece on a goal and flick it into the goal it's supposed to go in. (If it's player 2's turn, flick it towards player 2's goal.) Ace is treated as a "1" card. Choose which lane you want to play on and place the piece on Start. Player 1 rolls the dice and moves the piece the number of spaces shown towards his goal. Then, Player 2 rolls the dice and moves the piece towards his goal. This will eventually get boring, so check out <a href="#face-cards">version 2</a> and <a href="#hand">version 3</a> for variations.</p>
        <h1>Winning</h1>
        <p>The first person who gets the piece in their goal is the winner.</p>
        <h1 id="face-cards">Version 2</h1>
        <p>In this version, the face cards are used. This is what to do if you draw a face card:</p>
        <table style="width: 50%; border: 1px; border-color: black">
            <tr>
                <th>Card</th>
                <th>What to do</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jack</td>
                <td>Invert piece position (if it is on 4, move it to -4)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Queen</td>
                <td>Move 3 spaces towards player 1's goal</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>King</td>
                <td>Move 3 spaces towards player 2's goal</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h1 id="hand">Version 3</h1>
        <p>You have 3 cards in your hand. Play the one that, with the least number of moves, is most likely to get you to the goal. Use the face cards as described <a href="#face-cards">above</a>.</p>
