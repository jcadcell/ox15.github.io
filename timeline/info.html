</head><div>You can move the timeline (drag mouse over timeline) and zoom in and out (mouse wheel up/down; this is almost impossible in iOS, since the same gesture is used for zooming in and out on the whole page). Clicking on a item will display info beneath the timeline (purple or blue text only if the background is blue).</div>
