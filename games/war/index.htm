        <table style="width: 25%">
            <tr>
                <td>Players</td>
                <td>2+</td>
            </tr>

        <h3>Play</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Shuffle the cards.</li>
            <li>Split the deck evenly between players, so players have an equal amount of cards. Place your cards facedown in front of you.</li>
            <li>The first player plays his top card and puts it face-up in the middle of the table, followed by each of the other players. The person who played the highest card wins all of the cards in the pile. If multiple players play the same card, there's a war.</li>
        </ol>
