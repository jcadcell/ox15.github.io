        <p><div class="important">This game might not run. It uses the "random" module, and my Python couldn't find it. Run this if you dare. </div>This is a zip file because the main game depends on the other file. Windows users can use the "Extract All..." option in the context menu. If you have 7-Zip, you can Extract Here. You don't need to make a new folder for the files. Here are the word lists for Anagrams (right-click and choose "Save link as...". If you want to make your own, left-click to see how it's done. You can't use these for Hangman because Hangman has its own word list in a different format. To make the program work properly, you should download all of the lists.</p>
