        <h1><a href="board.jpg">Challenger</a></h1>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>Use a Lego piece for each player. Choose a player to go first.
            Place pieces at start. Use a deck of standard playing cards and your
            own Challenge cards made from 3x5 cards. The Challenges are to be
            numbered A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C10, and D1-D10. For a shorter game, use
            only the A Challenges. The face card values are on the board. They’re
            the same as <a href="https://jcadcell.github.io/games/war.htm">War</a>.
            The Challenges should include knocking over towers made of Lego
            blocks, getting the piece to a certain square, and making the piece
            go down stairs.</p>
        <h1 class="western">Play</h1>
        <p>The first player draws a card and moves that many spaces.
            Jokers are not used in this game. If you land on a challenge space (the number on the space ends in 5 or 0), draw a challenge card. Place a Lego piece on the space where the lane starts. If you land on a multiple of 5, draw a challenge card and follow the instructions on the challenge card. The numbers on the cards should be 1-10 (or whatever you choose) #A3 is the challenge where you flick the piece from lane 1 to lane 2. If it doesn’t go all the way to lane 2, you still get points (the numbers in lane 1). For knocking over a tower, the number of points you earn is the value of the
            space your piece lands on plus a number of points (see the “Tower points” table)

        <p>This variation is like Challenger, except you don’t use the
            playing cards. Don’t take turns, just draw challenge cards. This
            results in a fast-paced game where everyone is trying to get the
            highest number of points. You can even have challenge battles, where
            one player (<i>P1</i>) is trying to get his piece into the other
            person (<i>P2</i>)’s lane and knock over a tower. But here’s the
            catch: If the tower is all the way in<i> P2</i><span style="font-style: normal">’s
            lane</span>, <i>P2</i> gets the points; halfway, divide the points up
            between P1 and P2; all the way in P1’s lane, P1 gets the points.</p>
        <h1 class="western">Winning</h1>
        <p>When you run out of challenge cards, the game is over. The player
            who has the most points from completing the challenges wins.
